# Alpha 0.0.6.0 The "New shiny" update

TODO : ADD ANIMATIONS (L2R & R2L)

This update WILL break anything from prior.

Added a logo for Copy Cat Css ! Also the title in the tab has been changed and a new favicon has been added.
Copy Cat Css is becoming more and more real by each step.

This is a major step for this project though it is far from complete.
