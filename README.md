# Current version :

Alpha 0.0.6.0

# Personal CSS framework

So uhh...

Yeah this is a css framework project of mine I plan on making for myself.

Documentation coming later. For now test.html is as far as i'll go when it comes to documentation.

A dedicated website will be made for this once it's going to be getting some real steam.

# CURRENT TO DOS :

- Fix the previous em being not 16px
- Finish gridded listing
- More header flexibility
- Non-neon color options
- Footers
- Form controls
- Flexible columns
- Custom Icons

# Do you REALLY wish to use it ?

For now I don't know why you'd use it for realsies on any projects. If you wish to figure stuff out yourself : goodluck.
JS missing.
